spirit
------
usage: spirit { promote | demote } <player-name> <pantheon-name>
       spirit set <player-name> <spirit-level> <pantheon-name>
examples: spirit promote Angus Valhalla
          spirit set Elna DemiGod

Adjusts the spirit level of a given player.  Promote bumps up the player one
level in the chosen pantheon, demote does the opposite. Set takes a spirit
level as an argument and sets the player to that.

Specifying a pantheon is optional.  If left off, the global pantheon will be
assumed.
