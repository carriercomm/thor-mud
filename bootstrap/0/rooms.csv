0,Vaulted Junction,"You are standing in a large vaulted junction with halls that trail off in the
four cardinal directions.  Marble pillars line the way in each direction."
1,Balcony of the Sky,"You are standing on a marble balcony.  A night sky stretches above you with
uncountable numbers of stars dotting the sky.  Over the edge of the balcony
you can see the stark side of a mountain tail away into mist.  You cannot see
the bottom."
2,Hall of Valkyries,"You are standing in a twelve sided room with a domed ceiling.  Across from
the enterance stands a tall golden statue of Brynhildr, spear in hand.  In
front of the each of the five facets of the room on either side of her stand
silver statues of additional shield-maidens."
3,Throne Hall,"There's a big ass throne in the center of this room.  It's splendor cannot
be described. So we won't bother."
4,Spawning Room,"This is a close, almost claustrophobic room like the inside of a cave.  Moss
adorns the rugged stone walls.  In the center of the room there is a rippling
pool of water, however at the bottom is not ground, but it appears to be the
inside of a marble room."
